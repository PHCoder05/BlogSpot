# Share Button Dark Mode Visibility Fix

## Issue Description
The user reported that "share button showing only after hover in dark mode", indicating that the share buttons were not visible enough in dark mode and only became visible when hovering over them.

## Root Cause Analysis
The share buttons in the blog cards were using `text-blue-500` class without any dark mode specific styling. In dark mode, the blue color (`text-blue-500`) might not provide sufficient contrast against the dark background, making the buttons appear invisible or barely visible until hovered.

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Updated Share Button Styling
Added dark mode specific text colors to all share buttons across the application:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/home/Home.jsx`
- `src/components/blogPostCard/BlogPostCard.jsx`

**Changes Applied:**
```javascript
// Before
<FaShare className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-500 group-hover:animate-pulse" />
<FaShare className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-500" />
<FaShare className="text-blue-500" />

// After
<FaShare className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 group-hover:animate-pulse" />
<FaShare className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400" />
<FaShare className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400" />
```

### 2. ShareDialogBox Component
The `ShareDialogBox` component in `src/pages/allBlogs/AllBlogs.jsx` already had proper dark mode styling:
```javascript
className={`transition-colors duration-200 hover:text-blue-500 ${
    mode === 'dark' ? 'text-white hover:text-blue-400' : 'text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-600'
}`}
```

## Technical Details

### Color Changes
- **Light Mode**: `text-blue-500` (unchanged)
- **Dark Mode**: `text-blue-400` (lighter blue for better contrast)

### Affected Components
1. **Home.jsx** - Featured posts grid and list views
2. **BlogPostCard.jsx** - Reusable blog post card component
3. **AllBlogs.jsx** - Uses ShareDialogBox (already properly styled)

### Benefits
1. **Improved Visibility**: Share buttons are now clearly visible in dark mode
2. **Consistent UX**: Users can easily identify and interact with share buttons
3. **Better Contrast**: The lighter blue (`text-blue-400`) provides better contrast against dark backgrounds
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All hover effects and animations remain intact

## Testing Results
- ✅ Build completed successfully without errors
- ✅ Share buttons now visible in dark mode
- ✅ Hover effects and animations preserved
- ✅ Consistent styling across all blog card components

## Future Enhancements
1. Consider adding hover state indicators for better user feedback
2. Implement accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
3. Add loading states for share operations
4. Consider adding share count indicators

## Related Issues
This fix addresses the final visibility issue in the series of dark mode improvements:
1. ✅ Featured post text visibility
2. ✅ Featured post title visibility  
3. ✅ Share button visibility

All blog content elements are now properly visible in both light and dark modes.
