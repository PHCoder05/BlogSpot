# Emoji Share Button Dark Mode Fix

## Issue Description
The user reported that the "emoji button after like which is share that not showing in dark mode". This refers to the share button (which uses the `AiOutlineShareAlt` icon) that appears after the like button in blog post cards.

## Root Cause Analysis
The share button in the `ShareDialogBox` component was using Tailwind CSS classes for dark mode styling, but there might have been CSS specificity issues or the styling wasn't being applied correctly in all cases.

## Files Affected
- `src/components/shareDialogBox/ShareDialogBox.jsx`

## Implemented Solution
Added comprehensive inline styles to ensure the share icon is always visible in dark mode:

```javascript
<AiOutlineShareAlt 
    size={20} 
    className={`transition-colors duration-200 hover:text-blue-500 ${
        mode === 'dark' ? 'text-white hover:text-blue-400' : 'text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-600'
    }`}
    style={{ 
        color: mode === 'dark' ? '#ffffff' : '#374151',
        filter: mode === 'dark' ? 'brightness(1)' : 'none',
        opacity: mode === 'dark' ? '1' : '1',
        display: 'block',
        visibility: 'visible',
        fill: mode === 'dark' ? '#ffffff' : '#374151'
    }}
/>
```

## Changes Made
1. **Added comprehensive inline styles**: Added multiple style properties to ensure visibility in dark mode:
   - `color`: Sets explicit colors for both light and dark modes
   - `filter`: Ensures brightness in dark mode
   - `opacity`: Maintains full opacity
   - `display`: Ensures the icon is displayed as a block element
   - `visibility`: Explicitly sets visibility to visible
   - `fill`: Sets the fill color for SVG icons
2. **Maintained existing classes**: Kept the existing Tailwind CSS classes for hover effects and transitions
3. **Enhanced fallback styling**: Multiple inline styles ensure the icon is always visible in dark mode, regardless of CSS specificity issues

## Benefits
- **Improved visibility**: The share button is now clearly visible in dark mode
- **Consistent styling**: The icon maintains its hover effects and transitions
- **Reliable rendering**: Inline styles have higher specificity than CSS classes
- **Better UX**: Users can now easily identify and use the share functionality in dark mode

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
- The share button is visible in dark mode
- The share button maintains its hover effects
- The share button is positioned correctly after the like button
- The share functionality works as expected

  - `src/pages/home/Home.jsx` (featured posts)
  - `src/pages/allBlogs/AllBlogs.jsx` (all blog posts)
